        <p class="lead mb-4"> The Knowledge I have gain form my pervious Jobs has stuck with me and helped me grow as a person. The biggest thing I have taken away from my professional experience was the importance of time management. This skill has helped me with other aspects of my life.  One of the biggest, unexpected area when my professional experience was in my time in higher education. Being able mange time has made my time at university much easier. I can plan out my assignments so that they do not overwhelm me. I also learned how important stay organized and schedule thing out as well opening a dialog with my professors. Many of the skills that I have learned are applicable to my personal life as well. Having an organized life makes things easier, the structure a job provides is something that I really enjoy and help with me staying on top of all the things I must do in my life. <br><br>

        One of the jobs that taught me the most, and the job I was al the longest, was my time at the fast-food resultant Wingstop. I worked there for four years and spent the majority of that time as a shift lead. As a shift lead it was my job to plan out and lead the worker during my shift a work. I had to quickly learn to be organized because I was in charge if the manager was not in or was busy. Having to make sure that every other worker was on top of their station was the focus as shift lead. I also had to keep track of my job as well, I normally at the register taking orders. Making sure that I was doing my job properly and making sure that my co-workers were also doing their taught me the importance of time management and staying organized. It was also my job to answer the phone and take phone orders and deal with any customer complaints. Staying organized and managing my time made my job much easier and faster. My time as a shift lead was a great learning experience, being responsible for not just myself by other as well was great as it taught me many things. I had to learn to think on my feet when something unexpected and make sure everything went well during my shift.<br><br>

       Many of the thing I learned at Wingstop were also helpful in my other jobs since many of the same skills transferred over. At my next job I used may of the same skill but the one skill that helped me the most was the organization skill I learned. I worked in a grocery store as a casher and helped refiling shelves. For both of my responsibilities being organized was essential to getting my work done whether I was working at the cash register or stoking shelves. Being organized make me more efficient, I would plan out the fastest way to stock shelves and what was the most important things to shelve first. I also had to keep track and memorize codes and prices for fruits and vegetables.
